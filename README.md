This project is designed to package the new web version of Razer Comms into a fully functional desktop application using the [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) framework.

## Getting Started

You can download the installer from [Releases](https://github.com/njbmartin/razer-comms-desktop/releases), or if you're feeling adventurous, you can build this project yourself to see how it's created. At the very least, you will need a code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and you'll also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

1. Clone this repository
2. Open up the folder within Visual Studio Code
3. Open the `integrated terminal` (shortcut: `Ctrl+'`)
4. Run `npm i` to pull in the required node modules
5. Now run the build script using `npm run build:win`
